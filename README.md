I know this isn’t highly complex, but it’s a nice approach.
Feel free to expand or improve the program as you like.

With the addition of DMA (Direct Memory Access), you can avoid the expensive purchase of the KM box.

Have fun :)

What do i need?

A Arduino Leonardo (Not a Uno or the cheap ali express fakes) 
A USB Host Shield
Connect everything to the breadboard and install the butten etc. correctly.
If you dont wanna use the LCD Display etc. you can simply delete the code.

You might inform yourself how to spoof your Arduino to get detected as a serial mouse device.
Im just simply help all those skids to set up their RCS device.
